                Hello, my name is Adam Buchanan, and welcome to my website! I am a senior Applied Computer Science major
                with a minor in Business set to graduate in May of 2023. Outside of the classrom, I enjoy playing sports
                of all kinds, hanging out with friends, playing videogames on my XBOX and PC such as Valorant and Rocket 
                League, and going to church and youth group at NewSpring Church! As far as HTML and CSS experience goes,
                I took a class in high school that I really enjoyed, and it set the groundwork for what I am doing now in
                this class, CSCI 225. I hope to improve not just my HTML and CSS skills, but also Javascript and other skills
                involved in web development. I am actually working on a website outside of school right now for a summer camp
                that I used to attend, so I am really looking forward to learning as much as I can in this class to
                contribute to the website! So, welcome, and I hope you enjoy your time here!
            </p>

                Music is a really big part of my life, though I do not play an intrument, I have music on almost constantly.
                Depending on my mood or the situation, I will listen to several different genres. For example, if it is a chill
                kind of night, I will listen to <a title="Country Roads" href="https://youtu.be/1vrEljMfXYo" target="_blank">country</a> 
                or maybe some <a title="Tanjiro No Uta" href="https://youtu.be/WEfZfqocMM4" target="_blank">lofi</a>. Music helps me
                to focus on whatever I need to accomplish and get done what I need to! I especially listen to music when I'm coding
                or creating websites. It helps give me ideas and create a rhythm to keep going. Try them out for yourself!

                <li id="firstP"><b>Bus Route Planning System</b><br>
                    My group and I used Java in Eclipse to create a bus route planning system
                    that would calculate the distance to a certain location, the amount of gas
                    to be used on the trip. stops along the way, and if a gas station would be
                    necessary to reach the destination. Skills involved were Java programming,
                    database creation and management, GUI and console implementation, and
                    communication between group members.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Joke Generator</b><br>
                    My group and I created a joke generator that would allow a user to pick from
                    various categories of joke types and other selections and provide a joke and
                    punchline for the user. Skills involved were Java programming, creation and 
                    implementation of audio files, creation and management of a small database,
                    and GUI implementation.
                </li>
                <li><b>How-To Website</b><br>
                    I created a website that walked a user through the downloading of a videogame
                    known as Clone Hero on their Mac device. Skills involved were HTML and CSS
                    programming, much like in CSCI 225.
