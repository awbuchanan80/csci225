            <h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Adam Buchanan, and welcome to my website! I am a senior Applied Computer Science major
                with a minor in Business set to graduate in May of 2023. Outside of the classrom, I enjoy playing sports
                of all kinds, hanging out with friends, playing videogames on my XBOX and PC such as Valorant and Rocket 
                League, and going to church and youth group at NewSpring Church! As far as HTML and CSS experience goes,
                I took a class in high school that I really enjoyed, and it set the groundwork for what I am doing now in
                this class, CSCI 225. I hope to improve not just my HTML and CSS skills, but also Javascript and other skills
                involved in web development. I am actually working on a website outside of school right now for a summer camp
                that I used to attend, so I am really looking forward to learning as much as I can in this class to
                contribute to the website! So, welcome, and I hope you enjoy your time here!
            </p>

            <li><b>Bus Route Planning System</b></li>
            <p>
                My group and I used Java in Eclipse to create a bus route planning system
                that would calculate the distance to a certain location, the amount of gas
                to be used on the trip. stops along the way, and if a gas station would be
                necessary to reach the destination. Skills involved were Java programming,
                database creation and management, GUI and console implementation, and
                communication between group members.

            </p>
            <li><b>Joke Generator</b></li>
            <p>
                My group and I created a joke generator that would allow a user to pick from
                various categories of joke types and other selections and provide a joke and
                punchline for the user. Skills involved were Java programming, creation and 
                implementation of audio files, creation and management of a small database,
                and GUI implementation.
            </p>
            <li><b>How-To Website</b></li>
            <p>
                I created a website that walked a user through the downloading of a videogame
                known as Clone Hero on their Mac device. Skills involved were HTML and CSS
                programming, much like in CSCI 225.
